The 2nd ItaCa Workshop will take place in Genoa, Italy, on 20-21
December, at DIMA.

We are especially glad to announce this ItaCa Workshop after the COVID19
pandemic prevented the event from taking place in 2020, and we are
looking forward to meeting you in person.

ItaCa Workshop is a series of short workshops organized by [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io), the
Italian community of category theorists. The focus lies on the development
and applications of category theory.

Students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged to
attend and to submit talk proposals.

The workshop will take place *in person*, but we plan to stream the talks
on the ItaCa and DIMA YouTube channels. We also plan to register the
talks and to upload them on the ItaCa YouTube channel.

Participation is free of charge, but registration is mandatory. Note that to access DIMA a valid Italian green-pass or equivalent certification is required. 

Due to safety regulations, *the number of participants is limited*.
Available places are assigned on a first come, first served basis.

We are trying to secure funds to offer shared accommodation to students
and anyone who does not have access to other funding sources. Further
information will follow.

For inquiries, please send an e-mail to one of the [organisers]({{ '/committees' | relative_url }}).
