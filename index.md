The 2nd ItaCa Workshop will take place in Genoa, Italy, on 20-21 December.

We are especially glad to host this ItaCa Workshop after the COVID19 pandemic prevented the event from taking place in 2020, and we are looking forward to meeting you in person.

ItaCa Workshop is a series of short workshops organized by [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io), the Italian community of category theorists. The focus lies on the development and applications of category theory.

Students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged to attend and to submit talk proposals.

The workshop will take place in person, but we plan to stream the talks on the ItaCa and DIMA YouTube channels. We also plan to register the talks and to upload them on the ItaCa YouTube channel.
