ItaCa Workshop is a series of short workshops organized by [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io), the
Italian community of category theorists. The focus lies on the development
and applications of category theory.

Students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged to
attend and to submit talk proposals.

The workshop will take place *in person* at the [Department of Mathematics (DIMA)](https://dima.unige.it) of the [University of Genoa](https://unige.it), but talks will be streamed on the ItaCa and DIMA youtube channels.
